##Structure and content
- Unique ID and clear title: Each test case needs a unique identifier and a title that clearly references the feature being tested.
- Description: Include a summary of the test's objective.
- Pre-conditions: List any conditions that must be met before the test can be executed.
- Test steps: Break down the test into small, actionable steps. Avoid composite phrases and keep the steps concise (e.g., a maximum of ten steps).
- Test data: Specify the exact input data required for the test.
- Expected results: Clearly describe the expected outcome of the test, ensuring it is specific and verifiable.
-Post-conditions: Outline the state of the system after the test has been executed.

##Best practices for quality testcases
- Clarity and simplicity: 
	Test steps should be simple, clear
	One testcase should focus on single objective.
	 

- Reusability and Modularity: 
	Identify and reuse common pre-conditions (e.g., Login as a customer)

- Traceability 
	Link each test cases to specific requirements, user stories, or features (eg., role based - Bank Customer, bank Employee, etc)
	

- Expected Result Guidelines: 
	Write specific outcome in complete sentence
	Avoid vague phrases like "it should work"
	Example of good expected result "Application ID is created and displayed in the Review page"
	

- Negative Test Cases
	Write test cases to cover all requirements with expected outcomes
	Cover negative testcases for invalid, missing inputs
	Validate proper error messages and restricted field behavior
	
- Avoid repetition: 
	Do not repeat test steps. If another test case's steps are required, reference its ID in the pre-conditions.
